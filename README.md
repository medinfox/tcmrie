# TCMRIE: A Benchmark for Evaluating Large Language Models in Traditional Chinese Medicine Case Information Extraction

TCMRIE is a comprehensive benchmark designed to assess the performance of large language models on the task of information extraction from Traditional Chinese Medicine (TCM) case records.

## Dataset
The TCMRIE dataset encompasses original TCM case texts along with their corresponding structured extraction results. Notably, the dataset has been meticulously reviewed and validated by TCM professionals to ensure accuracy and relevance.

## Evaluation Metrics
We employ commonly used evaluation metrics from other information extraction tasks, with enhancements tailored to the nuances of TCM case information extraction.

## Capabilities of TCMRIE

By leveraging TCMRIE, you can:
- Benchmark the performance of various large language models on TCM case information extraction tasks.
- Compare the effectiveness of different models in this specialized domain.

Below is a visual representation of the performance of some well-known models on the TCMRIE benchmark:

## What is tcmrie?
tcmrie是一个用于指导大语言模型选择的，针对中医医案信息抽取任务的评估基准。它可以评估不同LLM在中医医案信息抽取任务上的性能。

该评估基准的数据集来自中医专业人员审核，评估指标采用其他信息抽取任务常用的评估指标并加以改进。
